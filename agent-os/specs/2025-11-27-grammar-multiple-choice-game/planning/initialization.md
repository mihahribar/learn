# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Add a new grammar game where users complete sentences by choosing the correct form from multiple choice options (a/b/c). The game should:
- Present a sentence with a blank to fill in
- Show multiple choice options (a/b/c) where one is correct
- Other options contain incorrect grammatical forms
- Example: "have got" vs "has got" exercise

The user provided an example image showing a worksheet-style exercise with 20 sentences testing "have got/has got" usage.
