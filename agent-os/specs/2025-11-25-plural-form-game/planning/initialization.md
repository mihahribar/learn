# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Create another game where the player needs to select the correct plural form. Add correct plural forms to all words on record and then also add a couple incorrect plural forms (for example mouse: mouses instead of mice). Keep the same simple style and remember the user is 11 years old.
