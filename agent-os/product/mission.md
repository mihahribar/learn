## The Problem

### English Spelling is Hard for Slovenian Speakers

Slovenian is a phonetic language where words are spelled as they sound. English spelling is notoriously irregular, with silent letters, multiple ways to spell the same sound, and exceptions to every rule. This makes English spelling particularly challenging for Slovenian children.

**Our Solution:** A game-based approach that uses audio pronunciation, Slovenian translations as context clues, and immediate positive feedback to build spelling confidence through practice.

## Differentiators

### Bilingual Support Built-In
Unlike generic English spelling apps, SpellBee provides Slovenian translations and hints throughout. The child sees familiar Slovenian words alongside English, reducing cognitive load and building natural associations.

### Two Learning Modes for Different Needs
- **Listen & Spell** builds active recall and listening comprehension
- **Pick the Right Spelling** builds pattern recognition and confidence with new words

### Encouragement-First Design
Wrong answers receive gentle, constructive feedback in Slovenian. Multiple attempts are allowed. The goal is building confidence, not punishing mistakes.

### No Account Required
Progress saves locally. No sign-ups, no passwords, no data collection. Parents can trust it, and kids can start playing immediately.
